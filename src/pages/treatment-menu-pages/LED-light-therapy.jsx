                        <p>
                            An LED treatment involves a Light Emitting Diode (LED) placed over the face or 
                            part of the body.

                            LED is a non invasive treatment that delivers clinically proven therapeutic 
                            light energy for rejuvenating and corrective benefits.

                            Specific wavelengths absorbed by the skin stimulate cell renewal and collagen 
                            production.
